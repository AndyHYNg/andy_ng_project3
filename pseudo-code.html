<p>objective: have the player (dug) reach from the finish line (top row of grid) without running into any obstacles</p>
<h2 id="dug-player-">dug (player)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have jQuery keypresses<ul>
<li>moveUp() =&gt; moves the player up one tile up (y+1) provided it is not a north edge (in which the player does not move), then calls checkObstacle(), then calls checkWinCondition()</li>
<li>moveDown() =&gt; moves the player up one tile up (y-1) provided it is not a south edge (in which the player does not move), then calls checkObstacle(), then calls checkWinCondition()</li>
<li>moveLeft() =&gt; moves the player up one tile up (x-1) provided it is not a west edge (in which the player does not move), then calls checkObstacle(), then calls checkWinCondition()</li>
<li>moveRight() =&gt; moves the player up one tile up (x+1) provided it is not an east edge (in which the player does not move), then calls checkObstacle(), then calls checkWinCondition()</li>

<h2 id="obstacles">obstacles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obstacles very in different bg-images, animation speed, and direction (left or right)<ul>
<li>animation speed and direction are chosen at random (in the case for animation speed, from a range set)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obstacles&#39; pseudo-code:
  a. have a function loop infinitely which takes a bg-image, random animation speed, and random left/right direction
  b. set a setTimeout with millisecond given by the random animation speed
  c. check if it goes left or right (if left, run a decrement for-loop, otherwise run an increment for-loop)
  d.  i) removeClass of obstacle-a, then draw obstacle-a (addClass) at the starting position (this is fixed for simplicity)<pre><code>  ii) call checkObstacle()
  iii) loop i) with incrementing/decrementing x-axis
  iv) consider break conditions (a. when player wins, b. when timer runs out, c. when player ran out of lives)

<p>a. if dug has &quot;health points&quot; - 3HP - will need to consider
